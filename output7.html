    <h1>Job Title:</h1>
    <p>"Harnessing ChatGPT for Automated Structured Data Extraction Using AWS Lambda"</p>
    <h1>Job Description Summary:</h1>
    <p>We will create an AWS Lambda function that uses ChatGPT to extract information from documents and creates structured content in JSON format. This function will be invoked by a website with an S3 bucket and a folder object. The function will fetch all files contained inside the folder, extract zip files and save the content to a sub-folder inside the bucket. It will then extract contents of all pdf, docx, and doc files and send them to ChatGPT for processing. The results from Chat</p>
    <h1>Problem Statement:</h1>
    <p>
Create an AWS Lambda function that uses ChatGPT to extract information from documents and creates structured content in JSON format.
1. The lambda function will be invoked by a website with an S3 bucket and a folder object.
2. The function will fetch all files contained inside the folder. Any zip files will be extracted, and it's contents saved to a sub-folder inside the bucket.
3. The contents of all files of filetype pdf, docx, and doc are extracted, and sent to ChatGPT for processing
4. The results from ChatGPT are processed to extract pertinent information, and create a single JSON object, which is saved as a JSON file to the bucket
5. When the function is complete, a webhook is sent to the website with the URI of the JSON object.
