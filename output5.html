    <h1>Proposed Solution:</h1>
    <h2>Technical Feasibility:</h2>
    <p>The MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js) is a combination of technologies that can be used to develop powerful web applications. It provides a full stack development environment to quickly develop efficient and robust applications. MongoDB is used to store data, Express.js provides the web application framework, React.js is used to create user interfaces, and Node.js is used to build the back-end.

The MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS and Node.js) is a combination of technologies that can be used to build efficient and powerful web applications. MongoDB is used to store data, Express.js provides the web application framework, AngularJS is used to create user interfaces, and Node.js is used to build the back-end.

The FERN Stack (Firebase, Express.js, React.js and Node.js) is a combination of technologies that can be used to develop efficient and robust applications. Firebase is used to store data, Express.js provides the web application framework, React.js is used to create user interfaces, and Node.js is used to build the back-end.

For mobile development, Android, iOS, Unity, and React Native are all viable options. Android and iOS are the most popular platforms, with their own development environments and languages. Unity is a powerful game engine that can be used for game development, as well</p>
